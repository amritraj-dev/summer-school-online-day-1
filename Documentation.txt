1. What each HTML element does:
2. Why you chose specific input types:
3. How your navigation structure works:

<h1> to <h6>:
- Define headings in decreasing importance from <h1> (important) to <h6> (least).
- Help structure content hierarchically for readability and accessibility.

<nav>:
- Defines a navigation section containing links to other pages on the website.

<ul> and <ol>:
- <ul>: Unordered list used for skills.
- <ol>: Ordered list for sequential items used for education.

<img>:
- Displays an image. The "alt" attribute provides alternative text for screen readers and when the image cannot load.
- width and height set proper size.

<table>:
- Used to display structured data, like work projects, in rows and columns.

<form>, <input>, <textarea>, etc.:
- <input type="text">: For entering a name or text.
- <input type="email">: Ensures a properly formatted email.
- <input type="tel">: Allows phone number input, with pattern validation.
- <textarea>: Allows multi-line text input for messages.
- <input type="checkbox">: For selecting multiple contact methods.
- <input type="radio">: For selecting one option out of a group (e.g., inquiry type).
- <input type="submit">: Submits the form.
- <input type="date">: Lets users choose a date via calendar UI.
- <input type="range">: Provides a slider for urgency level (0â€“5).

HEADER, MAIN, SECTION, FOOTER:
- <header>: Contains the page title and navigation.
- <main>: Main content area of the page.
- <section>: Organizes related content logically.
- <footer>: Contains copyright.

INPUT TYPE SELECTION:

- type="email": Validates that input includes an email format (e.g., name@example.com).
- type="tel": Designed for phone numbers and allows pattern restrictions.
- type="date": Provides a user-friendly date picker.
- type="range": Good for numeric selections like urgency levels.
- type="checkbox" and type="radio": Ideal for multi- and single-select questions.
- Using proper types ensures better user experience and built-in form validation.

NAVIGATION STRUCTURE:

- The <nav> element wraps a list of links to other pages: Portfolio, About, Contact.
- Each page includes a navigation menu for easy access to other sections.
- Links use relative paths (e.g., "about.html") to keep them functional across local or deployed environments.
- This improves usability, encourages exploration, and is consistent across the site.
